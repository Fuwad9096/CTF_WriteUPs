What is the web-based server management tool that is used here?


## Steps

**1.** Filter out the `http` requests

**2.** We see the `http` requests as follows:

![cockpit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b900a854-15c8-4309-98e2-b81b2273dc02)


**3.** We see that in the `Info` tab we see `login` access for something named `cockpit`

**4.** `cockpit` is a very popular web-based server management system. So, the flag is:

```bash
KCTF{cockpit}
```
